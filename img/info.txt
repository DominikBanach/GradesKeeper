About the app:
GradesKeeper is app made by Dominik Banach and it works with Vulcan. 
Connecting with Vulcan is very easy, GradesKeeper will show you how to do it step-by-step.
After creating an account, you can see your school timetable and your grades.
Moreover, GradesKeeper can show you recived messages or future exams.
It will show you some statistics about your grades too.

About security:
Data taken from your account is used by app only on your computer.
Data will be never used by me or anyone else. 
The fact that you have connected app with your Vulcan account doesn't give me permission to
send messages by this account or changing anything. It only allows my app to get data from it.
Obviously, only for usage by the app.

Vulcan account and internet connection are necessary for using GradesKeeper.
